# ``MediaShareApp``

Add a Media browser app to your keyboard extension for users to share gifs, clips or stickers. 

## Overview

Your keyboard extension built using [Fleksy Keyboard SDK](https://docs.fleksy.com/keyboard-sdk/) can enjoy extra functionalities with the FleksyApps. These are add-ons you can easily enable in your keyboard extension to enhance the user experience of your keyboard.

The MediaShareApp allows you to a media browser to your keyboard extension. You can choose between 3 types of media:
* Gifs
* Clips
* Stickers
It offers the user with a list of items of the selected media format, a list of trending searches for the user to select from and the ability to search for media. When the user taps a media item, it gets copied to the clipboard so that they can paste it in the app they are using.

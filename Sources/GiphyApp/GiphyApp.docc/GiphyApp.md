# ``GiphyApp``

Add a Giphy-powered gif browser to your keyboard extension.

> Warning: The GiphyApp has been deprecated and will be removed in the future. It has been replaced by the MediaShareApp from the same Swift Package, which, besides Gifs, also supports Clip videos and Stickers.

## Overview

Your keyboard extension built using [Fleksy Keyboard SDK](https://docs.fleksy.com/keyboard-sdk/) can enjoy extra functionalities with the FleksyApps. These are add-ons you can easily enable in your keyboard extension to enhance the user experience of your keyboard.

The GiphyApp allows you to add a Giphy-powered gif browser to your keyboard extension. It offers the user with a list of trending gifs, a list of trending searches for the user to select from and the ability to search gifs. When the user taps a gif, it gets copied to the clipboard so that they can paste it in the app they are using.

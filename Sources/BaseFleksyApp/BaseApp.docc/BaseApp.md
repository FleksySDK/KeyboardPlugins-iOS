Create custom FleksyApps for your keyboard extension built with [Fleksy Keyboard SDK](https://docs.fleksy.com/keyboard-sdk/). 

## Overview

Your keyboard extension built using [Fleksy Keyboard SDK](https://docs.fleksy.com/keyboard-sdk/) can enjoy extra functionalities with the FleksyApps. These are add-ons you can easily enable in your keyboard extension to enhance the user experience of your keyboard.

The `BaseFleksyApp` allows you to very easily create your own media-selector FleksyApps for your keyboard extension. It offers all the UI and functionalities of a media selector with category filter and user search. You only need to implement the methods that provide the `BaseFleksyApp` with the content to be shown.
